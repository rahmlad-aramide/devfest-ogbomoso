## Deploying to Netlify

You can deploy this project to Netlify using either the web interface or the Netlify CLI. Here's how to do it using the CLI:

### Using Netlify CLI

1. Install the Netlify CLI globally:

```bash
   npm install netlify-cli -g
```

2. Login to your Netlify account:

```bash
netlify login
```

3. Initialize your project (run this from the project root):

```bash
netlify init
```

This command will guide you through the process of connecting the project to Netlify. It will ask you to:

- Create a new site or link to an existing site
- Set up your build command and publish directory

4. Deploy your site:

```bash
netlify deploy
```

This will provide a draft URL to preview the site. 5. When you're ready to deploy to production, use:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

6. Your site is now live! The CLI will output the live site URL.

#### Continuous Deployment

To set up continuous deployment:

Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.

Run netlify init if you haven't already, and choose the option to connect to a GitHub repo.

Netlify will automatically deploy your site whenever you push changes to your connected GitHub repository.

#### NOTE:

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
